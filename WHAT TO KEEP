1. WHAT TO KEEP:
-Ensure you keep the following files and directories, as they are crucial for training and deploying your custom object detection model:
- Models/ Directory: Contains model architecture definitions. You'll need these to define and modify your model's structure.
-data/ Directory: Houses dataset configuration files (e.g., .yaml files) that specify paths to your training, validation, and test datasets, as well as class names. Customize these files to point to your datasets.
-train.py: The main script for training your model. You'll use this to initiate the training process.
-detect.py: Used for running inference with your trained model. This script allows you to test your model on new images or videos.
-requirements.txt: Lists the necessary Python dependencies. Ensure all required packages are installed in your environment.

2. WHAT TO REMOVE:
-export.py: If you don't plan to export your model to different formats (e.g., ONNX, CoreML), this script can be omitted.
-hubconf.py: Related to PyTorch Hub integration. If you're not using this feature, it's not necessary.
-utils/ Directory: Contains utility scripts. Review its contents and retain only those utilities that your training and inference scripts depend upon.
-tests/ Directory: Includes test scripts. If you're not modifying the core functionalities or don't require testing, you can remove this directory.
-tutorials/ and docs/ Directories: Provide additional documentation and tutorials. If you've already familiarized yourself with YOLOv5 and don't need these references, they can be removed.
-Dockerfile and docker/ Directory: Related to Docker setups. If you're not deploying your model using Docker containers, these are unnecessary.
